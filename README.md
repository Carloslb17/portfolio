# Welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Carlos Lopez and this is a little summary of my journey through Data Science, Python and some experience in the Enginering field. 

Data-driven models are making a giant impact in business and are totally capable of obtaining relations and insights from data.
In my humble opinion, it's a great opportunity to learn new fields and technologies to apply in engineering. 
This might add value in all stages of a project and that's the reason when I started to introduce myself in Data Science with Python.


## About Me 

🚀 Passionate about the engineering field and fascinated by the powerful insights of Data Science, aiming to combine both fields. Masters in IA and Data Science.

🔊🔧 Bachelor/Degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Acoustics, and over four years of hands-on experience gained in the UK.

## 🚀 Python
I love using Python to solve real-world problems, whether it's data analysis, building ML models, or automating workflows. I’ve worked with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and more. Always looking to improve and write cleaner, more efficient code.

## 📊 Kaggle
I enjoy exploring datasets and experimenting with different modeling techniques. Still growing my Kaggle profile, but I’m excited to tackle more competitions and share insightful notebooks.

## 🤖 Machine Learning
Fascinated by how ML can complement engineering and real-time systems. I’m particularly interested in hybrid modeling—combining physics-based models with ML to get the best of both worlds.

## 🤝 Collaborative Projects
I believe the best way to learn is by building with others. Open to collaborating on Data Science, MLOps, or engineering-focused projects. If you're working on something interesting, let’s connect!

## 🔧 GitHub Improvement
Currently revamping my GitHub to better showcase my projects. Splitting things into structured sections so everything is clear and easy to navigate. Always looking for ways to improve!
