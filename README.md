# Welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Carlos Lopez and this is a brief summary of my journey through Data Science, Python and some experience in the Enginering field. 

Data-driven models are making a giant impact in business and are totally capable of obtaining relations and insights from data.
It's a great opportunity to learn new fields and technologies to apply in engineering. 

## About Me 

🚀 Passionate about the engineering field and fascinated by the powerful insights of Data Science, aiming to combine both fields. Masters in IA and Data Science.

🔊🔧 Bachelor/Degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Acoustics, and over four years of hands-on experience gained in the UK.

## 🚀 Python
It´s a game changer using Python, whether it's data analysis, building ML models, or automating workflows. I’ve worked with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and more. Here you have the repos I've worked on so far:

### Template Package – [Python package Repo](https://github.com/Carloslb17/python-course-package)

Template final project from 'Taking Python to production Onborading guide' from [Eric Riddoch](https://github.com/phitoduck). The goal is to establish a solid foundation for future scalable and production-ready applications.
  - **Automated Workflows** – Implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions for seamless testing and deployment.  
  - **Code Quality Assurance** – Integrated linters and formatters to enforce clean, maintainable code.  
  - **Command-Line Efficiency** – Utilized GitHub CLI for streamlined repository management.  
  - **Python Packaging** – Structured the project for easy distribution and deployment.  
  - **Shell Scripting** – Automated key development and deployment processes.  

## 📊 Kaggle
KAggle is a good place to explore datasets and experimenting with different modeling techniques. Still growing my Kaggle profile, but I’m excited to tackle more competitions and share insightful notebooks:

- [Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carloslopez17/titanic-notebook-comparation)
- [Competition - Predict Health Outcomes of Horses](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carloslopez17/health-horses-eda-random-forest-gridserachcv)
- [PCA with Random Forest and Xgboost](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carloslopez17/random-forest-xboost-pca-approach)

## 🤖 Machine Learning
Fascinated by how ML can complement engineering and real-time systems. I’m particularly interested in hybrid modeling—combining physics-based models with ML to get the best of both worlds.

## 🤝 Collaborative Projects
I believe the best way to learn is by building with others. Open to collaborating on Data Science, MLOps, or engineering-focused projects. If you're working on something interesting, let’s connect!
