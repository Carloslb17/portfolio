# Portfolio ðŸš§ (construction in progress)

# Carlos Lopez Barbera
Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Carlos Lopez  There is a little summary of my journey through Data Science, Python and some experience in the Enginering field. 

Data-driven models are making a giant impact in the business, and are totally able to obtain relations and insights from data.
In my humble opinion, it's a great opportunity to learn new fields and technologies to apply in engineering. 
This might add value in all stages of a project and that's the reason when I started to introduce myself in Data Science with Python.


## About Me 

ðŸš€ Passionate about the engineering field and fascinated by the powerful insights of Data Science, aiming to combine both fields. Masters in IA and Data Science.

ðŸ”ŠðŸ”§ Bachelor/Degree in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Acoustics, and over four years of hands-on experience gained in the UK.
